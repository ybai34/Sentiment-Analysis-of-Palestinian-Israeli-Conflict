Comment,"That feels like a false equivalence. Religions are demonstrably more or less violent in their teachings and beliefs, and available data on religiously motivated violence and conflicts reflect that. It’s simply not factually accurate if you’re implying we see a similar rate of religious violence. Many but not all religions have started wars over their beliefs, and some seem to motivate (or at least be used as justification for) wars and violence at exceptionally higher rates.

France is not a federation of states like the USA, and all laws apply to the full extent to the French territory, unlike the USA where states have a lot of freedom in implementing laws. Also, in the USA there is this idea that the federal state should mind their own business, and a lot of freedom is given to the different states. So, changing the constitution in the USA would cause plenty of headaches as it could make part of the population angry and need to apply the change at each state level, to ensure that local laws follow new rules.

62% of Ukrainians believe that elections should only be held after the war is over, according to a poll published by the International Republican Institute (IRP) on Oct. 24.
  

  
According to the results of the survey, only 22% of respondents prefer to see elections take place as early as March 2024, 6% would like to see elections take place as early as September 2024, and 3% in March 2025, if the war is still ongoing at those times.
  

  
A vast majority of respondents believe that Ukrainian diaspora communities should participate in Ukrainian elections, with 70% of respondents believing it is ""very important"" or ""somewhat important"" that Ukrainians outside the country vote in any upcoming elections, as opposed to 28% of respondents believing that the issue is ""somewhat not important"" or ""not important at all.""
  

  
Under Ukraine's Constitution, elections are prohibited while the country is in a state of martial law.
  

  
In addition to questions posed about upcoming elections, respondents were also asked about Ukrainians' support for being included in NATO.
  

  
79% of Ukrainians would vote in a referendum to join NATO, if one was held, with 5% intending to vote against joining the bloc of nations. The results highlight a 20 percentage point increase since April 2022, when 59% of respondents supported Ukraine joining NATO.
  

  
When asked about respondents' support for Ukrainian government officials, President Zelensky topped the list of support with 82% of respondents indicating they ""approve"" of the work the President is doing, down slightly from 89% in February 2023.
  

  
Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba scored second on the list with 71% of respondents approving his performance, followed by Oleksiy Danilov, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, with 59% of respondents approving of his performance.
  

  
A random sample of 2,000 Ukrainians respondents was conducted September 9-12 through computer-assisted telephone interviews. The results are deemed accurate within 2.2 percentage points 19 times out of 20.",2023-10-29T22:38:26,Silly-avocatoe,15,Comment,https://kyivindependent.com/poll-62-of-ukrainians-favor-postponing-elections-until-after-war/

Comment,"Yeah, I feel like it would be extremely risky to do this. Considering it looks like the vast majority both support holding off on an election and also still support Zelensky, it's extra not worth the risk. 

Also, according to the article, their constitution doesn't allow for it anyway, so they would have to amend their constitution in order to hold the election.

Russia cannot win a war of attrition and they know that. They're in WW1 against Ottoman Empire phase, lol. At that point it'll take an extremely long time to even go back to a healthy population not inundated with health issues.

Comment,"Honestly I see this ending the same way Russia left WW1. Eventually too many people realize they've lost and they either a) gotta get rid of Putin or b) wont have a Country being able to be rebuilt.

At a certain point the sunken costs into the war will be too much.

A war of attrition will only happen if the U.S stops providing aid. Even then Europe will step up it's game on a widespread scale. But that's what would make the attrition evenish.

But atm Russia can't fire enough artillery shells compared to Ukraine, doesn't have enough drones, and doesn't have air superiority. And has lost a widespread amount of modernized tanks and artillery. 

I also wouldn't call it a stalemate. Mines suck and take time to get around, it's why Ukraine had to adopt from going in Vehicle first to going in with squads with no vehicles which worked well.

I also wouldn't compare last year to this year. Ukraine still has taken nearly twice as more landmass back this year than Russia did during their offensive.

It's more slow, sure. But it's not a stalemate.",2023-10-29T23:03:57,Ithikari,10,Comment,https://kyivindependent.com/poll-62-of-ukrainians-favor-postponing-elections-until-after-war/
Comment,">Honestly I see this ending the same way Russia left WW1.

It took 3 years and catastrophic military defeats (Tannenberg) for Russia to collapse under the horrors of WWI. And that was against a massive front with both the Germans and Austrians marching into their territory.

This conflict is on a much smaller scale, and practically none of it is affecting Russian territory. They can keep this up for a while.",2023-10-30T00:19:48,Eagle4317,1,Comment,https://kyivindependent.com/poll-62-of-ukrainians-favor-postponing-elections-until-after-war/
Comment,"Thanks for going into depth and explaining your reasoning.

On the point of whether it's currently a stalemate.

>I also wouldn't compare last year to this year. Ukraine still has taken nearly twice as more landmass back this year than Russia did during their offensive.

Ukraine has recaptured 370 square kilometres in their offensive this year. That's about 0.3% of the land Russia is occupying. As you point out, mines have been shown to be very effective at stalling armoured attacks. I call it a stalemate.

It's absolutely true Russia (and Ukraine) are suffering horrific losses. Commentators have been predicting the Russian army would collapse since the first few weeks of the war. Maybe it will eventually happen, like in World War I.

Comment,"Objective answer.  Putin's narrative (like NK, Iran, etc.) is about U.S.-backed oppression/aggression.  Ukraine becoming Westernized - U.S.-backed aggression.  Norway wants to join NATO - U.S.-backed aggression.   So any U.S. backed aggression/oppression, real or not (and their backing of Israel in this situation is of course very real), is low hanging fruit for condemnation from his regime.

Comment,"It's complicated. Russia and Israel have normal diplomatic relations and an Israeli delegation even travelled to meet Putin at the beginning of the Ukraine invasion i order to possibly convince him to chill. They have a certain level of access other western countries don't. Russia also allows Israel to take out targets inside Syria. There are also a LOT of Russian Israelis. But there is caution between the two countries as well based on Russia's ties to Iran and Syria, and Russia's anti-semitic history.

So whether Hamas was supported by Russia via Iran is a question, but an indirect one. It would be counterintuitive for Russia to support Hamas in my opinion. Also Russia doesn't really like terrorist groups e.g. Chechen and solidly supports existing states e.g. Syria. Supporting terrorist groups goes against its stance on sovereignty.",2023-10-30T00:24:14,BowlerSea1569,1,Comment,https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israeli-bombing-gaza-has-killed-50-hostages-hamas-official-tells-russian-2023-10-27/

Hamas’s main bases is under the Shifa hospital. Israel knows. Hamas knows Israel knows. The building is crawling with Hamas terrorists who walk the same hallways as the doctors and provisional government officials. The tunnels are known to connect to the basement of the building. They do their torture here, so having medical facilities available is a good idea. 

When Israel hits these places, it’s not because they want to kill civilians.

The Muslim world is rioting right now and America stays with Israel.

It’s not about Hamas. Islamic jihad, lions den and all the others too irrelevant for me to know about should all be destroyed.

The world needs to deal with facts. If the world wants Palestinians to heal they should help Israel destroy terror AND at the same time bring hospital ships and build a refuge camp in Sinai with medical facilities and therapists. Let all innocents out and if there is doubt someone is a risk of terror apprehend him and investigate. Let the international court put him to trial and those still in Gaza should be recognized as casualties of war on terror.

Comment,"When you take in refugees, it is expected they go back when that's possible. If that never becomes possible, it's understandable when a people start asking when they're leaving. Just like at your house, it's like hey! Great you came, I'm glad you made it! A couple decades later, if it's not already diverse, it's to be expected. If me and a bunch of other midwesterners went to S Korea, I believe we'd be welcomed but expected to leave again at some point, or integrate.",2023-10-30T01:02:34,The-Entity,1,Comment,https://www.foxnews.com/world/pakistan-deport-undocumented-afghan-nationals-un-seeks-relief-deadline
Comment,"Just to be clear, Pakistan has at various points in time been the destination for Afghan refugees. Post-Soviet invasion, for example, and more recently, the Taliban takeover. 

Many of the Jewish people who immigrated to British Mandated Palestine/Israel were also refugees. The Holocaust in Europe, and persecution in Russia and North African and Arab states were some of the sources of these refugees. 

Are you asking what the reaction would be if Israel kicked out its Jewish refugees?

It is not that strange for mass migrations of people to trigger tense attitudes in the countries which play host to them. You can see this happening today in Poland with Ukrainian refugees. Even in Canada there is some displeasure with the perceived favoritism being shown to Afghan refugees. 

Perhaps without realizing it, you have asked a question which hits at the heart of the current conflict- only in the case of the migration of Jewish peoples to British Mandated Palestine did the migrants declare to themselves an independent nation.

If you can understand how and why immigration can sometimes fray the goodwill of the host population (as in the case of Pakistan), you can understand the root of what's going on in Palestine/Israel today.",2023-10-29T22:21:12,ImranRashid,5,Comment,https://www.foxnews.com/world/pakistan-deport-undocumented-afghan-nationals-un-seeks-relief-deadline

Comment,"Abdullah II is in a pretty precarious position. There are a lot of Palestinian refugees in Jordan, some Jordanians are very sympathetic to the Palestinians, and his wife is a Kuwait-born Palestinian as well.

That being said, Abdullah II is also realistic. He knows first hand what happens when extremism amongst the refugees gains traction, given Black September happened under his father when he was a kid. Abdullah II will probably always try to toe the line as much as possible just to keep the peace, he recognizes Israel as a state and is often the mediator between Israel and Palestine, even being the official guardian of Holy sites in those lands. Jordan has seen a lot of development in its education reforms and equality of genders under Abdullah, and his mother is British. He's a lot more sympathetic to the West than people realize, but he is still the leader of a Muslim nation and people, and I think he realizes that swaying too heavily to one side would be detrimental for Jordan as a whole in terms of civil unrest, etc.",2023-10-29T20:07:38,kikistiel,410,Comment,https://www.reuters.com/world/jordan-says-asked-washington-deploy-patriot-air-defence-missiles-2023-10-29/

Comment,"> I don't think it's ever been admitted they are nuclear delivery capable, but my guess is they are.

Since the 1990s the Navy's public policy is not to load nuclear weapons on anything other than Boomers:

> The declassified numbers end in 1991 with the offloading of non-strategic naval nuclear weapons from US Navy vessels. After that only strategic missile submarines (SSBNs) have continued to deploy with nuclear weapons onboard. Those numbers are still secret.

> The last nuclear weapons division on the USS John F. Kennedy (CV-67) is disbanded in February 1993. The following year the entire surface fleet was denuclearized.

Comment,It's kind of false advertising then. We'd all surely be expecting at least a little bit of fire with a *Hellfire* missile. This should be something like the Swordsofinsanity missile. That's much more appropriate.,2023-10-29T23:40:08,Alpha-Particles,1,Comment,https://www.reuters.com/world/jordan-says-asked-washington-deploy-patriot-air-defence-missiles-2023-10-29/
Comment,"I think OP in this chain was suggesting that you wouldn't need the blades, because the kinetic energy caused by a hellfire missile (even if unarmed with explosives) would be enough to kill a soft target (human in a car) with ease. 

But I think the blades are just assurance and help expand the kill area within the impact region. IIRC, when we killed that Iranian general with one, the overall impact area on the car really wasn't that big (could see the hole(s) in the roof). That's all to say, the cross sectional area of the hellfire missile variant was maybe approximately about the size of 3-4 watermelons arranged in a square, at *most* - not sure why I'm using that unit of measurement. 

That's all to say that the blades do make sense, as the**y're** a weight-and space-efficient means of expanding the kill area, on an a missile not equipped with explosives, without requiring a much larger missile, with more fuel, a higher unit cost, etc. Making the missile larger would mean a greater cost, likely higher chance of failure given the thoroughly tested RX9 platform and long history of use, and increase collateral damage due to unburned fuel, larger mass, more debris flying around. Whereas my understanding is the bladed variant of this missile in particular was specifically designed to minimize collateral (and likely in part as a ""flex"" - or because, why not?) damage

That's my take on the OP's comment and my own understanding of why the blades are necessary in this case and are preferable to alternative methods within this particular use case

It's unlikely that their missiles have the range to threaten Israel, which makes his statement basically doubly false. It not only didn't happen, but there's evidence that it couldn't happen.

Comment,"Article:

**For 30 years, the resource-rich North African desert territory has been 80% controlled by Morocco. But three years ago, the Algeria-backed Polisario Front renewed its armed struggle for independence.**

Four explosions were reported in the city of Smara in Morocco-controlled Western Sahara, local authorities said on Sunday.

One man was killed and three others injured in the blasts, which also damaged two houses, according to a statement by officials.

The AFP news agency cited local authorities as saying the blasts hit three different neighborhoods of Smara.

Two people who suffered serious injuries were transferred to a hospital in Laayoune, 200 kilometers (around 125 miles) west of Smara.

Images on social media, which cannot be verified, show the partially collapsed roof of an empty house as well as some metal debris. 

**Police open investigation into blasts**

The judicial police were investigating the source and nature of the projectiles that hit the residential area, judicial authorities said in a statement.

The attorney general ""has entrusted the investigation team with carrying out the necessary technical and ballistic expertise to identify the origin and nature of the projectiles,"" said a statement quoted by Morocco's MAP news agency.

Situated in North Africa, Western Sahara has been mired in conflict since 1975 when former colonial power Spain withdrew from the territory.

That sparked a 15-year war between the Algeria-backed Polisario Front and Morocco for control over the territory.

A 1991 cease-fire deal gave control of 80% of the desert region to Morocco and Polisario, through the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, controls the rest and continues to seek an independent state.

Morocco has said autonomy is the most it can offer as a political solution.

**Renewed fight for independence**

In November 2020, Polisario said it had resumed its armed struggle.

Most of the fighting was described by the United Nations as ""low intensity,"" and occurring mostly in the uninhabited eastern part of the Morocco-built security wall.

The UN Security Council has urged the parties to the conflict to seek a mutually acceptable solution.

On Thursday, the Polisario Front said in a statement that it had ""targeted strongholds of Moroccan occupation forces near Hanka Houria"" in the Smara region.

""The attacks by the Sahrawi army continue against the Moroccan occupation forces, which are suffering heavy human and material losses along the wall of shame,"" it added.

The wall, which was erected by Morocco in the 1980s, stretches over 2,700 kilometers (around 1,677 miles) and separates the Morocco-controlled part of Western Sahara from the territory the Polisario considers ""liberated.""",2023-10-29T18:46:41,MaleficentParfait863,8,Comment,https://www.dw.com/en/1-dead-3-hurt-as-multiple-blasts-rock-western-sahara/a-67249509

Comment,"Lol, ok. I’m totally cool with being on the side that’s fighting the terrorists who behead infants and toddlers, tortures & kills kids in front of their parents and vice versa, rapes kids and young people, kidnaps innocent babies, kids, women and the elderly, holds civilian hostages in violation of international law (an ACTUAL war crime), and slaughters innocent people. We are absolutely clear that you people like Hamas feel YOU are entitled to kill others when they don’t do exactly what you want or even if they simply make the “mistake” of being born Jewish. We got it. There is no room in a free world for people like that. So I am absolutely good with Israel eradicating Hamas. Soldiers may have come back and died by suicide after the GWOT, but many of them - the majority of them - live free, peaceful, worthwhile lives in the comfort of a country that recognizes their sacrifice.

Comment,"I know you have the AI and HRW links saying it's apartheid, but neither explain how when Gaza and WB are not part of Israel. They're separated by borders. Whatever happened in Gaza is hamas's fault, they could have used their billions to create their own infrastructure and nation. They didn't. If there's any occupation or apartheid in Gaza, they chose it.   
  
You seem to think hamas has no agency. They could have gotten all their international aid even without Netanyahu, even from western nations. They could have taken the money and played the long game, but instead chose to starve their people. That's on them, Netanyahu doesn't control them.   
   
I wonder where you were on October 07. Did you care about the attacks at all, or you only cared when Israel retaliated?

Or should you blame Hamas for not even letting them escape, so more people die, therefore making Israel look worse?
Heck, they build military bases under schools, hospitals, and more just so Israel wouldn't be able to get them without looking horrible (Again, it's TERRIBLE that they have to bomb those places, but who's really to blame when Hamas is the one starting all the wars?).

Comment,"Today I am not sure it is an extremely complex and difficult situation, but if in the past they hadn't seen and used Hamas and other terror organizations as useful counterweight to the moderate parties in the Palestinian Authority that would've been nice. If Israel and the US hadn't after every failed peace talks labeled the Palestinians as the reason for them failing when the truth is the failure is shared between all 3 parties. Finally if Israel would not have been continuing to expand the settlements in the West Bank of which from people on reddit that say they are or know Israelis that the majority of Israelis don't want nor support the settlements.


Copy paste for the 2000 Camp David talks

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4137467](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4137467)

At Camp David, Israel made a major concession by agreeing to give Palestinians sovereignty in some areas of East Jerusalem and by offering 92 percent of the West Bank for a Palestinian state (91 percent of the West Bank and 1 percent from a land swap). By proposing to divide sovereignty in Jerusalem, Barak went further than any previous Israeli leader.

Nevertheless, on some issues the Israeli proposal at Camp David was notforthcoming enough, while on others it omitted key components. On security, territory, and Jerusalem, elements of the Israeli offer at Camp David would have prevented the emergence of a sovereign, contiguous Palestinian state.

These flaws in the Israeli offer formed the basis of Palestinian objections. Israel demanded extensive security mechanisms, including three early warning stations in the West Bank and a demilitarized Palestinian state. Israel also wanted to retain control of the Jordan Valley to protect against an Arab invasion from the east via the new Palestinian state. Regardless of whether the Palestinians were accorded sovereignty in the valley, Israel planned to retain control of it for six to twenty-one years.

Three factors made Israel's territorial offer less forthcoming than it initially appeared. First, the 91 percent land offer was based on the Israeli definition of the West Bank, but this differs by approximately 5 percentage points from the Palestinian definition. Palestinians use a total area of 5,854 square kilometers.

Israel, however, omits the area known as No Man's Land (50 sq. km near Latrun),41 post-1967 East Jerusalem (71 sq. km), and the territorial waters ofDead Sea (195 sq. km), which reduces the total to 5,538 sq. km.42 Thus, an Israeli offer of 91 percent (of 5,538 sq. km) of the West Bank translates into only 86 percent from the Palestinian perspective.

Second, at Camp David, key details related to the exchange of land were leftunresolved. In principle, both Israel and the Palestinians agreed to land swapswhereby the Palestinians would get some territory from pre-1967 Israel in ex-change for Israeli annexation of some land in the West Bank. In practice, Israel offered only the equivalent of 1 percent of the West Bank in exchange for its annexation of 9 percent. Nor could the Israelis and Palestinians agree on the territory that should be included in the land swaps. At Camp David, thePalestinians rejected the Halutza Sand region (78 sq. km) alongside the GazaStrip, in part because they claimed that it was inferior in quality to the WestBank land they would be giving up to Israel.

Third, the Israeli territorial offer at Camp David was noncontiguous, break-ing the West Bank into two, if not three, separate areas. At a minimum, asBarak has since confirmed, the Israeli offer broke the West Bank into two parts:""The Palestinians were promised a continuous piece of sovereign territory ex-cept for a razor-thin Israeli wedge running from Jerusalem through from \[theIsraeli settlement of\] Maale Adumim to the Jordan River.""44 The Palestinian negotiators and others have alleged that Israel included a second east-west salient in the northern West Bank (through the Israeli settlement of Ariel).45 Iftrue, the salient through Ariel would have cut the West Bank portion of thePalestinian state into three pieces"".

Comment,"The civil war in Lebanon was caused by economic, social, and security issues(the central government had little control over the country and relied on a number of militias to control and ensure security). What is seen as what started the civil war is when the Christian militia attacked a bus carrying Palestinian refugees and the PLO retaliated then it caused counter attacks by each side.

https://www.britannica.com/event/Lebanese-Civil-War

The civil war in Jordan was caused by the PLO, but some background to why should be added when talking about it. The refugees from 1948 were accepted into Jordanian society at least the ones that couldn't or wouldn't claim the right to return mainly the middle and upper class of Palestinians were as the refugees from the Six Day War weren't and both the 1948 and 1967 refugees were treated poorly. The King of Jordan was perfectly fine with the PLO attacking Israel, but didn't want them to do so out of Jordan because he was worried about his place at the top and had been secretly talking with Israel since the 1950s.

You'll have Egypt willing to send Palestinians food and aide. But they are not accepting any of them as refugees or allowing them the settle in Egypt until the fighting in Gaza is over. None of the countries that border Gaza or Israel are willing to do this.

Why? Because there are several examples of Palestinian refugees getting into literal wars with their host countries. There's a reason why many Ukrainian refugees were able to flee the country and live in other European nations, while virtually not a single Middle Eastern country is willing to do the same for Palestine. They'll send Palestinians food and medicine. But nobody wants to actually be the ones who are responsible for dealing with them.

Comment,"Look I don’t have the details, nobody in the public does but the fact is Israel was warned by a government entity that they have diplomatic relations with that an event like what we saw could emerge from the Gaza area.

Comment,Are the moderate parties in the Palestinian Authority the best option no can there be better parties yes. The Fatah party for all it's flaws and genuine negative attributes has at least formally recognized Israel and wants the 2 state solution. This is a complex and nuanced issue too many people jsut choose to blame one side or the other which depends on which side they belong to. One of the things the world can do is demand that the practice of those pensions be ended or that if not international aid will be reduced by say 20% for the first year then another 5 or 10% every year after and since the Palestinian people rely on that aid and the ruling party does too(embezzlement) then that might just end the practice.,2023-10-29T21:53:36,Longjumping-Jello459,1,Comment,https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/gaza-war-entered-new-stage-and-will-be-long-and-difficult-says-netanyahu-123102900009_1.html

Comment,"Didn't say that either though

Look, you get the point, I appreciate that anyway

The way this works is, Israel's far rightists make deals with Hama's allies (this comes in variable types of exchanges), Hama's allies follow up with arms and supplies sent to Hamas of which Israel doesn't intercept to the full extent of their capability (eg smuggling and bribing) as part of the deal. Give it years, it all trickled in. This has been going on for a while, incidentally while Netanyahu has been in power, and it reached a point (incidentally around when Russia invaded Ukraine) where war planning was then made coordinated by Hama's allies. Again Netanyahu is a known criminal for bribery and fraud.

Then the attack happened

A huge part of the reason why the PA is unpopular among Palestinians is because it cannot and will not protect them against Israeli violence and ever growing settlements taking Palestinian land.

This is also why Hamas can be considered more “popular” - they promise to protect Palestinians from Israeli aggression. Now the way they do this is by unjustifiable terrorism means, but it explains why Palestinians may be more inclined to be sympathetic to a government that at least claims to protect them.

In his address to the Conference, Sharon stated that ″settlements which will be relocated are those which will not be included in the territory of the State of Israel in the framework of any possible future permanent agreement. At the same time, in the framework of the Disengagement Plan, Israel will strengthen its control over those same areas in the Land of Israel which will constitute an inseparable part of the State of Israel in any future agreement.″[14] It was at this time that he began to use the word ""occupation"". Bernard Avishai states that the Gaza withdrawal was designed to obviate rather than facilitate peace negotiations: Sharon enivisaged at the same time annexing Jerusalem, the Jordan Valley, and the major settlements like Ma'ale Adumim and Ariel which he had in the meantime developed, and thereby isolate Palestinians on the West Bank in territory that constituted less than half of what existed beyond the Green Line.

Today we have the PA in the West Bank, which has recognized Israel statehood for years. They have been and continue to be a good partner to Israel and open to a two-state solution.

Comment,"Assuming you're being genuine here:

You need to be in the mindset of people in Gaza. It's a giant refugee camp, 2 million people crammed in the equivalent of a metro area after being driven (often through force) from their homes generations ago. Half the population are children, poverty and malnutrition are rampant. 

If you work on the Israeli side you're subjected to humiliating and seemingly arbitrary searches, which can leave you stranded on one side or the other for days. 

If you ever go near the border fence, you die; sometimes even if you're far away, Israel regularly strikes in Gaza during hot periods. You know babies, mothers and fathers who were incinerated in their homes by Israeli bombs. 

You have no job, no future and no hope, at the constant humiliating mercy of the enemy who lives in your grandparents' home. Is it any surprise that you then turn to people who promise revenge?

You can criticize the plan all you like, it doesn't change the fact that it showed Israel that leaving an occupied area wasn't enough to lead to peace, and created a significant terror threat. So the WB unfortunately will remain occupied until the Palestinians can prove that won't happen again in the WB.

You're being a little disingenuous there saying they haven't got much in return. Israel offered them the WB, Gaza, parts of East Jerusalem, neutral control of holy sires, and land swaps to link Gaza and the WB. Abbas turned it down.

Comment,"The several hundred thousands of original Palestinian refugees have now millions of descendants. When they were originally displaced, hundreds of thousands were granted citizenship in surrounding nations, especially Jordan, but also large numbers in Egypt and in Syria.

A large number of refugees also lived in the West Bank, or as it was called then, Transjordan, which was annexed (illegally) by Jordan, and in Gaza, which was de facto part of Egypt until the six day war. From 1949 until now, even when directly under the governments of Jordan and Egypt, about half of these Palestinians have never been granted citizenship, partly because they have instead been used as a bargaining chip by the Arab League to garner international sympathy for the refugee crisis. It is also true that Palestinian refugees have attempted several coups and assassinations in these countries, but I disagree this is the major reason that refugees have not been more accepted for decades now. There is also a destabilizing effect of large numbers of refugees which Egypt claims, which has some truth to it, but again, all the countries involved have responsibility for these people, regardless of the history, including Egypt.

Israel will not allow them to return to where their ancestors were displaced, because now their population has multiplied several times over and if granted citizenship in Israel, have given all indications that Israel would cease to exist and the Jews would be expelled and massacred. This is what happened to Jews in Jordan, Syria, Egypt, Lebanon, etc. starting in 1947-48. Most recently the last Jews were expelled from Yemen by the Houthi rebels, which is a related topic to look into. These Jews, expelled from countries in the Middle East, mostly during and immediately after the 1948 declaration of the Israeli state and the following war for Independence, when Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan first attempted to exterminate all Jews in the Levant, make up more than half of Jews in Israel. The remainder are extremely varied, including Jews who fled the Holocaust, Jews who fled pogroms, especially in Eastern Europe, and many other groups.

So the Palestinian Refugees are millions of people trapped in a game of political football, and nobody is blameless. There are no easy one-sided narratives about the history of Israel and Palestine.

Comment,">The current Israeli government doesn't. They've offered multiple two-state deals that were flatly rejected.

This just isn't a factual statement.

The first crucial steps in normalizing diplomacy between the PA and Israel were undertaken by Fatah and the Israeli Labor Party in 1993 - but they were put on hold after Netanyahu won office following the assassination of  Rabin in '95. Coincidentally, some of Netanyahu's campaign stunts included posters with images of Rabin in a set of crosshairs, and a mock funeral procession where pallbearers shouted ""Death to Rabin!"" while parading around a casket with Rabin's image posted onto it. Netanyahu was even made aware by Israel's security chief that there was a plot to kill Rabin, and was asked to please tone it down. *He refused.*

Fortunately, he wasn't in office very long the first time around, and negotiations were reopened under Ehud Barak.

The 2000 Camp David summit saw both sides being willing to make major compromises, but not enough to bridge the gap. There's plenty of blame to be placed on both Israel and the PA for the failure of the Camp David summit, though it's telling that Barak's Foreign Minister (who was present for the accord) stated that ""if I were Palestinian, I would also have rejected Camp David.""

But that wasn't the end of the peace process. They continued to meet and negotiate, with both sides proving willing to make even more concessions on what had been previously un-negotiable maximum demands, and by 2001 at Taba were *just about* to sign a viable, mutually agreeable two-state treaty.

But then Ehud Barak's term ran out, and the Likud party swept into office once more - and, once more, scrapped the plans and shut down negotiations.

The PA has, since '93, been extremely interested in finally coming to a negotiated settlement - much to its own detriment, as Palestinians become increasingly frustrated by the Israeli Right refusing to meet this diplomatic tack in good faith. They've not had a partner willing and able to meet with them for good faith negotiations in the Israeli gov't since 2001, though - and the Likud policy of seeking to consistently delegitimize and destabilize the PA is a major part of why we've arrived at the crisis we currently find ourselves in.",2023-10-29T19:33:29,WillDigForFood,3,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/palestinian-pm-we-will-not-run-gaza-without-solution-for-west-bank

The right of displaced civilians to return to their homes after fighting was over was a radically new concept compared to the entire rest of human history, where eradication, expulsion and assimilation of conquered peoples was considered SOP for victorious countries.  Under the rules of war in place in 1948, it was perfectly normal for an advancing army to uproot or destroy their enemy's supporters so that support would be weakened.  Just because it was later outlawed does not mean it was always that way, or that post-Geneva rules apply to pre-Geneva actions.",2023-10-29T19:38:12,Mobile-Entertainer60,16,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/palestinian-pm-we-will-not-run-gaza-without-solution-for-west-bank

This one. Gaza was the perfect test care for what would happen if Israel ceded land to an independent palestinian state. Almost immediately they elected hamas and we have been living with the tragic consequences of this decision for 15 years. Why would any Israeli look at that and think that an even larger, impossible to contain piece of land such as the west bank would not pose an even more serious existential threat to Israel?

The Arabs made a huge mistake in 1948 by attacking the newly-independent state of Israel thinking that they would easily defeat it and force the Jews from the region.

The problem is that instead of recognizing that time was not on their side to make a deal, they kept rejecting deals. Each time, their options get worse, not better.

That's one of my biggest issues with people pointing to the escalation of settlers in the west bank as reasoning or moral justifying Hamas' actions. We've seen it in Gaza, Israel is willing to remove settlements, and leave behind the greenhouses and other valuable infrastructure the settlers built for the Palestinians. That was on the table for the west bank with the 2008 deal with strong indication Israel has the means conviction to do it.

I do agree though with Iranian funding and their other proxies in the mix there is too much interest in using the Palestinians as pawns to make it anything less than even more difficult to get to peace now. 

On the Israeli end, what 7 October did in its all horror is also make it that much harder to get them to compromise that much again and at some point after several wars to fight of their eradication, and numerous terrorist attack each month, every year for decades on end, its hard not to see their point too.",2023-10-30T00:12:33,jchart049,1,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/palestinian-pm-we-will-not-run-gaza-without-solution-for-west-bank

Comment,I hear your critique and it's not totally unfounded. And going back and forth on what ifs isn't really going to change much. So I guess I'd just end by reminding that it wouldn't be the first time the IDF dragged settlers out of settlements under a right leaning government. I'm not saying it's the most realistic thing (especially now being reminded acutely the consequences of the Gaza withdrawal). I'm just saying I don't think people should be completely doomer pilled on peace even if a post 10/7 Israel goes more rightward.,2023-10-29T21:17:43,af_echad,2,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/palestinian-pm-we-will-not-run-gaza-without-solution-for-west-bank
Comment,"Yessir. Wrap that booger in cobalt and detonate it high in the atmosphere. “When the bomb explodes, the neutrons produced by the fusion reaction in the secondary stage of the thermonuclear bomb's explosion would transmute the cobalt to the radioactive cobalt-60, which would be vaporized by the explosion. The cobalt would then condense and fall back to Earth with the dust and debris from the explosion, contaminating the ground.”*

Comment,I would be more scared for Israeli democracy than for Palestine in that case as the current status quo from before Oct 7 fits the right well enough.  The one possibility for peace under a right wing Israeli government rhat I do see happening is if the US and Europe lays extremely heavy pressure on Israel to actually compromise and stop settlements.

Comment,"I hear ya on the Israeli democracy thing but I also think the whole right/left thing maps weird onto the Israeli public. It's less like purely right/left and more like a few axes of secualr/religious and hard on security/more lenient and then a way less influential economic right/left divide.

And even that probably doesn't cover everything. So while I could see Israel getting more ""right"" on security to an extent, I don't think the hundreds of thousand of people who were protesting Netanyahu's coalition before 10/7 are suddenly going to be ok with his judicial reform plans even if they're now more sympathetic for being tough on security.",2023-10-29T21:33:53,af_echad,1,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/palestinian-pm-we-will-not-run-gaza-without-solution-for-west-bank

It is for the destruction of Israel. If you give someone only one choice but to go to war against you, then what do you expect? You get war. You get your own people killed.

Comment,"Israeli citizens didn't deserve to die Oct. 7, 2023, lying in their beds, who had not even gotten up that morning, so the Hamas invaders drug the father, mother and the 7-year-old and the 3-year-old of this home into the TV room and shot all 4 numerous times. While one Hamas invader was going through the frig to find something to eat, the other one took out a machete and cut off all 4 heads after they were dead and then kicked them around the room like a soccer ball.

So, after it was semi safe the IDF sent in a large team to claim the dead. The Israeli in charge of cleaning up that particular house bagged bodies and put in family photos and papers he found to help identify them and placed 3 bags outside and marked the white bags with black marker. The general in charge of the operation came by to inspect and said, ""this house is marked 4 dead and I see only 3 body bags, what's going on?"" The worker said "" Everybody's head was cut off and I could identify the male father and the female mother but when it came to the two little girls, I couldn't tell which head belonged to who, so I put both bodies and both heads in the same bag along with family photos for ID. And that's why there are only 3 body bags for this house!!! The general shook his head and said, ""good job"" ""next house.""

Comment,"Obviously no innocent civilian deserves to die and you ask the question knowing he would likely say as much, but you are missing the point anyway. He is expressing that Israel is not upholding its duty to international law with the indiscriminate nature of their attacks. The scale of civilian deaths in this conflict is a direct result of Israel's military tactics, and he is trying to promote the idea that there are avenues between a non-response and leveling neighborhoods that can achieve whatever victory is supposed to be without killing nearly as many innocents. When it's as big an issue as it currently is, their deaths are more remarkably undeserved.

Comment,"Us doing this doesn't solve anything, westerners overwhelmingly already believe this as an axiom.

The core problem is that Islamists like Hamas and their supporters explicitly don't believe in equal worth for all humans. For example non-Muslims under Islamic rule are at best second class citizens who must be ""humbled"" and don't have equal worth or rights per Islamic law.

If Hamas achieved their stated goals they would exterminate all Jews and fully implement Islamic law (Sharia) globally. I'm not exaggerating, look at their founding charter.

If Israel achieved their stated goals we would have a two state solution with near-total autonomy for Palestine - the only restrictions being to prevent further attacks on Israel.

1st and foremost. You CANNOT change faith. Even different branches of Islam. You're a Murtad and the punishment is execution if you don't return to your original faith within 3 days.  
2nd. They traditionally inherit their faith from their fathers.  
3rd. Khalifa, caliphate, Sultan, Imam, whoever rules the land(Hamas, in this case) has the rights to call Jihad, and make decisions on some things.   
4th. They have been absorbed into Hamas and indoctrinated from a very young age using a few things:  
A. School books originally designed by Yaser Arafat's regime.  
B. Mosque prayers and religious gatherings that are optional but if you do not attend them you will be seen as weak of faith so you have to attend them.  
C. Youth groups created by Hamas to attract children to their cause.    
D. Money, Status  and government jobs.  
5th. Salafism is one of the most hardcore branches to ever exist.

Therefore, by fighting back, the enemy is killing your noncombatants and ipso facto violating the rules of war.

(The reason militaries don't do this is because it leads to a race to the bottom where the greatest strategic advantage goes to belligerents who care the least about their civilians, and frankly, as civilians, it is in our interest that not caring about us dying does not confer a major strategic advantage to our governments.)",2023-10-29T19:12:20,Fojar38,62,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

Comment,"If the opposing side dropped letters, roofknocks, made phone calls to the house, and hamas wouldn’t let my family leave the building, Id be upset with Hamas for keeping them hostage and using them as moral meat shields.

One side is a government that is for it’s people, by it’s people, open to and following international law, accepting criticism and openly admits fault. 

The other is a self-declared terror organization with no regard for the laws of distinction and proportionality, props their own men women and children as sandbags, refuses to engage in any sort of compromise or talks with any foreign body besides the theocratic demagogues tyrannically abusing their own civilians as well (iran), and has shown no interest in peace unless it is on their terms (the slaughter and exile of Jewish people)

The death of civilians is an absurd reality that cant be tolerated. But, what boggles my mind is why anyone pro-Palestinian would protest Israel, who actively wishes and tries so damn hard to root out Hamas without causing any civilian casualties, rather than Hamas, who who are not only wearing these people like armor, but diverting critical resources towards their own interests. 

Hamas does not care to represent the Palestinian people. 
Israel has shown infinitely more concern for them than Hamas ever has, or will, even if you believe for whatever reason it’s not enough.

Comment,"War crimes are practically a PR/politics thing. It's a judgement from peer nations in what is or is not acceptable. To some extent the everything is genocide judgement devalues the concept. If a country is treated as if all actions are the same as genocide like the Muslims countries regarding Israel it just licences them to commit more atrocity because they are already suffering the diplomatic damage as of they had done the worst.

Israel is only checked by the US/eu having a significant relationship and holding Israel to some standards.

And extremist recruitment is not only related to atrocity but also propaganda. If the culture is thick with propaganda, they will have no trouble recruiting even in an era where both sides left each other alone. 

You can see many examples where bombs didn't make terrorists. Vietnam after the Americans and French and Cambodian and Chinese invaded.  No vietnamese terrorists.

This is true. However the fact is that conclusively knowing which strikes do this and which don't is impossible in the thick of war absent an independent investigation. However labelling them as war crimes absent an investigation shows us you're not actually interested in the even-handed application of the law but simply want to use the law as a pretense to bash the IDF over your preconceived notions you already have about them.

Proportionality in war isn't a strict numbers game and generally speaking the side that gets to make the call is the side attacking the military target. It becomes even less of one when the enemy is intentionally placing civilians in harm's way. Allowing the tactic to succeed encourages the use of more human shields, which means more civilian deaths and suffering. It is not a war crime to strike a military target that the enemy has intentionally placed around civilians or civilian infrastructure.

Comment,">It is in fact legal according to the Geneva Convention to attack military targets ""protected"" by human shields, precisely to discourage the use of human shields.

This is correct. But it too has limits, like you described. 

These attacks must still follow the Principle of Proportionality, as defined by International Humanitarian Law. 

Think of it like cost-benefit analysis. The military gain from an individual strike must be proportional to the civilian deaths it causes, as well as the damage it causes to protected objects. Use of human shields doesn't negate that rule, it only affects the calculus, allowing for somewhat larger damage to be caused legally, than under normal circumstances. 

You can't bomb a large crowd of civilians to kill one combatant. That would be a violation of said principle. 

But you can bomb a large concentration of enemy combatants, that is using a small group of civilians as human shields, legally. 

There is no defined cost-benefit ratio, however. That would be something that is decided on a case by case basis, utilising something like the Martens Clause, or Principle of Humanity.",2023-10-29T22:51:27,ThanksToDenial,0,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

Do you remember when iraq had much much much much lower death counts until time passed and the conflict was shown to have an immensity higher? You should be expecting that. However thankfully it is true that what could have happened has been curtailed a bit by the US pressure and other pressures. But the invasion hasn't even begun yet this is just the pre-emptory bombing. And everyone can't escape the city in such a tiny small period of time especially when the escape path has been bombed. As a result there's really no positive situation to be discussed here.

Comment,"You can't stay that. You literally can't state that. To state that is to be so devoid of reality and humanity that you become a pointless existence.

You cannot say. ""Escape this way"" because we're coming. In a time period that was unrealistic in even a non war zone situation. And then bomb the areas they're escaping to. You just cannot do that. the UN even tried to sanction them for it and the US is the only one stopping it as they've done for decades and decades with their veto power.

An escape area can not be referred to if it is also a bombing zone. Further they have INCREDIBLY advanced US-top tier parity technology. They can do precision strikes with their missiles. They aren't.

And it's not nuance. It's you trying to ignore the atrocities of one side while hating on the atrocities of another.

Theres a long line of historical indications of evacuating people from dangerous areas. And the main universal thing is that they aren't also blown up on the way. Nor are their families houses then targeted.

Make no mistake, this conflict is complicated, both sides are lesser evils, both sides are guilty, and the current terrorist attack is the responsibility of Hamas and likewise Israel has a right to respond. But after that response and how they respond there will be another response from Hamas and it will feed back into it. And you won't be able to keep saying attacking only one for it.

Before we had even had time to process the horror of the reports, thousands of Palestinians including women, children, toddlers and babies, were being indiscriminately killed in retaliation for Hamas' actions, and that has continued every day since, at a rate of one child every 15 minutes.

It's extremely sad that the victims of the terror attacks have not been given more attention and screen time by the media and I can understand the feelings of outrage on behalf of the families of the hostages, whose terrible plight has barely been mentioned in the media coverage of the bombing of Gaza. 

The hostages appear to have been written off by the State of Israel and the US government from day one, as unfortunate victims of unavoidable collateral damage - judging by the political will of Israel in its prioritisation of flattening Gaza in a brutal ongoing collective punishment of the entire population, to avenge the shocking terror attack of October 7.",2023-10-29T19:55:45,throwawayfem77,-7,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

With attacks being stopped internally, and foreign aid not being stolen, the reason for the blockade goes away. Rebuilding can happen. With some time and good will, it may be possible that Gaza would not be an immediately hostile state, and negotiating a two state solution might resume.

Comment,"Alright, assume Israel decides that the bar for collateral damage is set to zero, meaning no action can be taken if there's a risk of a civilian being harmed. What happens next?

Do you expect Hamas to stop hoarding all the food, water, and medicine in Gaza? Do you expect Hamas to release all 239 civilians they kidnapped? Do you expect Hamas to stop firing hundreds of rockets a day at Israeli cities from within schools and hospitals?

No, what will happen is that Hamas will continue to embed themselves as deeply as possible into civilian population centres, continue hoarding all the resources as their own people starve, and continue trying to kill every single Jew in the middle east. Because if you tell a terrorist that being near a civilian is an impenetrable shield, they will hold on to that shield for dear life. Meanwhile if you accept some bar of collateral damage, of tragic, awful, heart-wrenching civilian death, then the terrorist doesn't have the incentive to endanger any more civilians.

That would be indistinguishable from basically serving up the IDF to Hamas on a silver platter because Hamas sure as shit isn't going to not use artillery and explosives on the IDF even if Hamas is destroying whole Palestinian neighborhoods. If you think you can fight a war using only small arms, especially in an urban environment, then you just do not understand how a war is fought.

Even Russia, famous for not giving a shit about the lives of its infantrymen, levels entire Ukranian cities block by block with artillery before sending in their troops because it is so incredibly dangerous.

But just for the sake of argument, let's say the IDF adopts your ludicrous and suicidal strategy to besiege a city while using only small arms fire.

the conflict and the treatment of palestinians in general has been a calculated effort to gain plausible deniability in the illegal annexation of the 4 occupied region. in 1967 only 1 month had passed from the end of the war to the first illegal settlement. Palestinian land has shrunk every year since. and i mean hey it works. just in the last 4 years they got recognition of 2 of the 4, and they expect the west bank to be added to that list in the next couple years. 

and now with israeli media reporting that the idf ignored warning from both the us and egypt of an imminent hamas attack, this ends up looking like their laying the groundwork for the reoccupation and annexation of gaza. 2 weeks before the attack they were already showing off their “New Middle East” map at the UN - the plan for Greater Israel has been in motion for a long ass time, they’re not backing out now",2023-10-29T18:38:10,FauxMoGuy,1,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

The IDF has absolutely gone door to door and killed innocent people (go read up Dair Yassin where they did exactly that, go read up on Plan Dalet, go read up on how they marched 3000 Palestinians at gun point into the Red Sea and watched them drown)

Israeli human rights organizations have documented for years the fact that the IDF shoots and throws grenades at Palestinians for sport. Hell, the Israelis were the first to start bombings when Igrun blew up the King David hotel in Jerusalem in 1946. They also don’t like to talk about the fact the Mossad ran a campaign of false flag terrorist attacks against Jews in Iraq because they were too well integrated and didn’t want to move.

Picking sides in this conflict is stupid - the political leadership of both countries derives all its power and legitimacy from its continuation. That is obviously true for Hamas and the PLO, but it is equally true for the Israeli government where every PM since Ben-Gurion has built their political career on how tough they are on the Palestinians. There’s a reason why an utter crook like Netanyahu is in power and it’s not because Israel is a “force for good”. It hasn’t been since it’s first action was to assassinate the first special rapporteur the UN sent down there.

The international community needs to stop picking sides in this conflict . Both entities need to be hit with crushing sanctions until the bullshit stops and they find a way to live together. Either that, or we need to step in and dismantle both countries and built them up again.

I'm not very convinced that anything the IDF is doing is removing Hamas' power base from Gaza. Removing their ability to launch rockets... maybe?

But if they wanted to remove Hamas, they'd treat this is a police action -- pay informants, track down leadership, capture them, try them. Shut down funding networks, hold an election so they're not legitimized, that sort of thing.

Comment,"""It's the first step: Hamas needs to go, and be replaced with a group that polices people trying to launch attacks, rather than sponsoring them.""

First of all, Netanyahu supported the Hamas take over of Hamas even though Fatah was an option (they recognized Israel's right to exist).  So Israel govt contributed to this.

Comment,"Japan really is not a good comparison at all. For starters, their feelings towards the U.S. no way matched that of the members of Hamas. They certainly did not like the U.S., but their hatred was much more geared towards nations like China they saw more as their historical rivals. Additionally, Japan was able to change its opinion with time given that they didn't really lose any of what they saw as their land (Manchuria, parts of China, etc. that they occupied were of course lost, but those were recent conquests). In fact, for the only place where they sort of did, Okinawa, which has a large chunk used as a U.S. military base, there is still a lot of resentment towards the U.S. in contrast, even if Palestine is allowed to keep the territory it does now, which I sort of doubt Israel would allow if it commits to a complete invasion, they will still long for the territories they lost decades ago they see as their ancestral claims. That is something you can't undo so easily, especially when they witness many of their friends and family dying to Israeli bombs. Really, that's one of the main issues here: Japan was able to change because they didn't really lose much in the long-term to make them vengeful. Moreover, the war was for less than a decade, not the several decades long conflict between the Palestinians and Israelis.

Comment,"Yes, ""legally"", it becomes a target. That doesn't necessarily make it right to blow up the hospital to target them. You have to weigh the costs in civilian lives versus the losses for the enemy, and bombing a hospital does a lot of damage to the civilians in the short and long term while you aren't even guaranteed to damage the headquarters, much less kill any Hamas members.

Hamas is in the wrong for blurring the line, but the IDF does not get a pass for killing civilians. Also, of course sources don't say whether the dead are part of Hamas or not - its already hard most of the time to ID different bodies, much less tell whether said bodies were part of an organization without any standard uniform or database of members. However, given the targeted areas are dense residential areas and as you said, Hamas tends to hide among civilians, chances are many of those deaths are civilians.

Sounds like a great opportunity to undermine them, then. Send in teams to distribute aid to individuals. Make it very clear that you will do so in advance, so that the local population knows that anyone who tries to stop you is their enemy. If nobody stops you, you have provided humanitarian aid and built local rapport for whoever you claim to represent. If somebody does, they discredit themselves. Either can be leveraged to undermine Hamas socially, denying them future recruits, and shifting the public opinion against them.

I don't understand how this is a feasible goal. 

As the US proved through two wars in the middle east, ideas like terrorism are hard to kill, especially when you reinforce the premise behind the idea in your attempt to eradicate it. 

Basically the more innocents you kill or displace the more Hamas / the idea of terrorism grows among the survivors. The US eventually emphasized a ""hearts and minds"" approach in an attempt to show an alternative way forward.

Furthermore, all these pro-Hamas morons accusing Israel of genocide would be laughable if it weren't such a problem.  The problem is that misapplication of that word is crying wolf, diminishing the seriousness of genocide, doing a disservice to humanity.

Hamas charter calls for the destruction of Israel and the death of all Jews.  This is textbook genocidal intent.  Israel is a multi-cultural, multi-ethnic democracy with over 2M Arab inhabitants who participate in a vibrant society as IDF soldiers, members of Knesset, mayors, etc.   Many were victims of the Hamas attack.  If Israel wants to wipe out the Arab population they're doing a poor job of it as the Arab population of Israel has grown from 156,000 right after Israel defeated the Arab nations that attacked her in 1948 to 2.1M now.  A >10x growth in population over 75 years is hardly indicative of genocidal intent.

Are you trying to read that kind of statement in good faith, or are you deliberately interpreting it in bad faith? Because that as a statement doesn't condone what Hamas did, it's a matter of whether or not this was a foreseeable attack. Push a wild animal into a corner, you shouldn't be surprised when you get bit. That doesn't mean you deserved to get bit, it's a matter of predictability.

Israel intended to shoot Gaza before this conflict? What? [Have you seen the Gaza population balloon in the past decade?](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Gaza-Strip-Population-Forecast-Results_fig2_262201993)

Or are you saying that Israel intends to shoot Hamas now, after their attack, in which case they'd already have stolen the hostage before they were cornered.

What the fuck is this analogy, lmao. The criminal would've basically had to have raped the police chiefs daughter, threw their newly born nephew into the oven, shot some other people just for the fuck of it, then took someone hostage because he knew the police department was going to come after him. Then on top of that, the criminal would have to have a secret underground tunnel where he's trying to infiltrate the police department headquarters (possibly for rape? maybe just to murder more?).

And also, the criminal would be actively shooting people with the hostage as protection. So yes you'd shoot the perpetrator. That's an easy, ""take the shot"".

Bro, this analogy is stupid as fuck. You don't understand the point of analogies. An analogy is just a microcosm. We're not going to find an analogy for the current conflict.

Comment,"You have a good point about the differences.  Japan did lose the idea that they were an empire.  Israel has no long-term interest in occupying Gaza -- not only have they announced this, but they departed completely in 2005.  

Are you arguing that no Japanese civilians witnessed the deaths of the \~3M Japanese civilians who died in WW2?  That they were oblivious to the bombings of Tokyo, Hiroshima, Nagasaki, etc.?

I agree that invasion will not, by itself, produce deradicalization.  I think that capitulation is an important step on the way to it.  Also, UNRWA has done the world a disservice with its grooming of terrorists -- perhaps a better educational effort might yield more peaceful results.

The day after the invasion is a worthy topic of discussion.  I wish I could snap my fingers and end violent jihad as an ideology, or I wish I could click my heels and have the populations across the middle east who have been taught and encouraged for generations to hate Israel accept that she is there to stay.

Comment,"> As the US proved through two wars in the middle east

It's effectively a couple of cities with a bit of countryside around it. This isn't Afghanistan, this isn't Iraq. An area of this size is a totally different beast than large countries. There are no mountains or remote villages where the terrorists can hide, only tunnels, which can be located and destroyed until there are none left. Hamas are stupid enough to attack from tunnel exits, making them both easy targets and giving those away.

> how much recruitment in Hamas 

Hamas are able to recruit, because they are the government of Gaza. They have control over people's lives. Schools, universities TV programs, social media, newspapers. They control health insurance and collect taxes, they issue permits and punish both ordinary criminals and those who work against them.

By eliminating Hamas as a government, they can never ever do anything like they did on October 7 ever again. That's the goal. Of course there will be some stragglers and splinter groups that might launch the occasional suicide bombing in the future, but those are manageable. As a large organization however, Hamas is on its deathbed.

> Oh and I'm sure withholding food and water is a great way to win hearts and minds

You don't supply your enemy during a war. Hamas has horded food, water, medical supplies and fuel for months. They are not giving it out. Israel is already sending in aid into areas they have seized from Hamas and have agreed on more aid from Egypt. 

That said, winning hearts and minds is not the goal of Israel. They are there to eliminate a threat to their national security. They are doing it as humanely as they can, but there is no perfect way of conducting warfare.

This situation is the textbook case of terror. They make you choose between two evils. Even if you do your best to mitigate damage, you still commit an atrocity. But your hand is forced. 

Should we try to talk it over? Well my enemy has declared religious Jihad on me and has no interest in seeing me or my civilians as humans, so i think compromise is kinda off the table. 

Do I make a concession? Maybe that will appease them and we can reach compromise at least? Well we tried that, didnt go well. They elected a Jihad group that vowed eternally to seek our destruction rather than accept the billions in foreign aid coming from nearly every place on earth. 

Now they’re shooting missiles at our cities indiscriminately! Thousands of them! Thank God the Americans have given us a missile defense system, otherwise the casualties would be so high it makes current palestinian death tolls look tiny.

They’re still bombing us! Talks arent leading anywhere! Breaking news: Terror group that vows eternal vengeance will not stop terrorizing! 

We have to respond by destroying Hamas infrastructure and the senior officials, this is unsustainable! The problem is they are building tunnel systems, weapon caches, ect. Under civilian infrastructure!

Comment,"Resolution 181 was rejected by the Arab nations. Then they attacked Israel the day after they declared their independence because they refused to recognize it. Five countries tried to invade and lost. Israel didn’t start that war but they did protect themselves. And a lot of those same people have never let go of that anger and hate. It also wasn’t the first act of aggression, the land was historically rife with unrest.

If it was actually about the land, they would have tried to re-negotiate the terms. But it’s simply the fact that they wanted Jews gone. 

There’s also the fact that you will try to claim the Jews stole the land but the truth is they have lived on said land for thousands of years, they had been legally purchasing land as early as the 1880’s, they were given land by the occupying power at the time, and they took over land after they finished a war they didn’t start. 

Pretty much every attempt at peace has been rejected by one side. Israel has had to put up borders and restrictions because of the constant terror attacks, they had to create the Iron Dome because the constant barrages.

And when Israel left Gaza in 2005 (including removing their own people’s settlements), Hamas violently took over. And they’ve spent the past nearly two decades terrorizing Israel and their own people, as well as radicalizing them. They’ve taken the billions in aid and used it to secure weapons to commit constant terror attacks, including the most recent horrific one on 10/7. And they’ve done so to the detriment of their own people, they steal and hoard supplies, they use their civilians as human shields, they prevent them from fleeing and leaving, they blow up their own people. Did you know that something close to a fifth of their own rockets launched at Israel, fail and land on their own land? They have received billions in humanitarian aid and they literally don’t even provide the most basic resources for their own people. They literally dug up their own water pipes and used the material for rockets. 

Hamas is the problem here. But it’s clear you don’t actually know what you are talking about, so this conversation is likely to go nowhere.",2023-10-29T17:23:45,SeveranceZero,7,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

Comment,"Per international law voluntary human shields are direct participants in the hostilities. If they're 'protecting' military sites by their presence and not being coerced, their injury or death are not violations.

For involuntary human shields placed to protect military targets, the attacking force has to make a judgment about whether the military purpose is worth it. However, that determination rests with the attacker and the deaths of the civilians are upon the heads of the individuals that forced them to be involuntary human shields. The presence of human shields does not and will never render any target immune to military action by their presence. It does not require an attacking force to place their own forces in harms way in order to reduce injury/death of human shields. And allowing human shields to do so would merely encourage the future use of more human shields, resulting in even more death.

""The presence or movements of the civilian population or individual civilians shall not be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations, in particular in attempts to shield military objectives from attacks or to shield, favour or impede military operations.

Comment,"Indiscriminate bombing has already been proven, attacking escape areas has already been well documented not just now, but in the past as well. Murdering of journalists has already been proven, not just now, but in the past as well. Even killing aid workers and such. Oppression via economics, oppression via illegal settling, etc.

I recognize Israel is one of those topics people want to put-context less statementss to, but the reality is that this isn't a good vs evil war. It's a lesser of two evil's type of war, with civilians on both sides getting caught in the middle, one for religious purposes and oppression purposes and one for religious and corruption purposes. And then the US is there backing one side up because way back when when we were hands off our CIA detected code words referring to suspected nuclear arms locations they would detonate if they were lost, and thus had a rapid mass air-drop of supplies and equipment and have been supplying them ever sense, largely to use them as a lightning rod for conflict in the Middle East so the US doesn't get dragged into many conflicts.

That's the situation over there. Plus the current leader of the government has been actively trying to suppress his peoples rights to remove or hold him accountable in the courts by changing the very abilities of the courts to him him accountable.

Meanwhile a terrible terrorist attack occurs due to propaganda and extremism and religion, ands ome people joining in on it via radicalization because of how Israel treated them, others just being extremists. Hostages get taken, civilians are lost heavily.

The war is good for Israel, it helps distract from Netanyuhu's many issues. Whether he had reports and intelligence referring to the oncoming attack and poorly responded intentionally is still unknown and we may never know since that data often gets squelched or suppressed for years. OR perhaps we will.

Regardless, while Israel has the right to respond regardless of the things they did to influence the tension in the first place, it would be a complete lie to the highest degree to claim they're being responsible in their handling of things. How much worse would it even be without the US President and other leaders trying to directly mediate and lessen the current already horrific response?

Except when I looked it up I discovered that the IDF was formed out of the paramilitary group that CONDEMNED those groups and had multiple armed conflicts with them to try and stop their efforts with casualties on both sides. The group has its historic issues as well but they were founded as a defensive force after Jewish communities were consistently attacked by their Arab neighbors and their major historic enemy were the British colonists that were deporting Jews and denying visas that were promised.

Comment,"No way at all.

Go back to the Three Kingdoms War in China and you've got that many dead *actually,* not adjusted for era. Tens of millions of civilians killed over a hundred years - like 1/5 the world.

The ways people died were different - but armies would go through and just erase entire towns and cities full of people - going back centuries.

Comment,">Nonsense. The casualties are heavier on one side simply due to technological differences. If the thousands of rockets Hamas has been firing weren’t being intercepted by the iron dome the casualty numbers would look very different. 

Doesn't seem like a technological difference to kill Gazan non-terrorists because of failed terrorist attacks. It seems more like Israel places little to no value on Gazan civilians.

>Also nonsense on indoctrination… there are 2 million Arabs who live in Israel - 20% of population. Israel was willing to split the land in two(Oslo accords), Hamas formed very much to stop that with terror attacks and succeeded. Hamas’ charter in clear black and white states that not an inch of land is to be given to the Jews and the only acceptable way to deal with Jews is jihad. 

>Heck a Gallup poll from a week before Oct 7th attacks showed that 72% of Gaza population do not want a two state solution. They’re not interested in peace, they want ALL of the land. One guess on how they’d like to accomplish that goal? The Jews are living in peace with 20% of their population that are Arab and were willing to split the whole thing.

The Israelis believe they have the right to a native people's land, and that they have no choice but to kill thousands and thousands of innocent natives to defend that right. That may make sense to Israel, but obviously it is nonsense to those native people. Both are as indoctrinated as the other from their perspective.

End the mistreatment of Palestinian with the West Bank and israel, have the blockade only refuse to allow weapons through, and start proposing solutions that aren’t heavily biased towards Israel.

I’m pretty sure they literally refuse to allow fishing boats from going to far out from the coast, and only some days allow Palestinian farmers to till their own land, it’s clear the poverty is very much due to Israel’s doing. With the actual proposing of a reasonable solution as a stepping stone and a great reduction of poverty in Gaza, and the removal of the West Bank settlements, Palestinians would have a way to attain their freedom or country or independence or whatever you wanna call it in a way that doesn’t require them to take it, and with that realization, support for Hamas would decline.

>If your position is that what the UN says is correct and must be respected unconditionally, then you need to explain why the entire conflict isn't the fault of the Palestinian Arabs who rejected the original two state UN resolution in 1948 and started a religious pogrom against the Palestinian Jews that escalated into war.

Comment,"When I hear ""destroy"" Hamas - I hear meaningless soundbites born of a fucking horrific trauma.

They flattened whole neighborhoods - a few nights ago they reported 1 Hamas higher up and some dozen foot soldiers killed - that was their result of droping 600 bombs that night ... surely those 600 only hit the same spot.

How many bombs did they drop in the last 3 weeks? 10k? I would call that bombing to pieces. And Hamas is still able to fire rockets.

They go in by ground because bombing did not solve the problem for the past x years.

How do you keep 10 guys pooping out of their tunnels, wielding AKs from going to your roof, fire their rockets and leave. Sure you would heroiclly stand there and tell them ""not on my roof"", get shot in the head and thats it ...

If the unarmed civilians would be able to removed Hamas from their tunnels - why the ground offensive including bombing for 3 weeks by IDF?

What IDF is doing there is forcing a humanitarian disaster onto 2.4 civilians in the hope that they will turn against Hamas. Some medival tactics there ... One might think of international humanitarian law.

Just listen to Yuval Harari or Gideon Levy or anything other than IDF spokesperson XY endlessly repeating ""they started it"" when questioned critically about their plan, hostages or basically anything. Hamas bad so anything goes.

Not to mention - their glorious exit strategy - we decide when its over and the international community/arab states can fix it afterwards because we are not responsible for those people we bombed for months, while controlling their water, food, electricity - they should just pull themselfs up by their bootstraps I guess ... like in the westbank - that glorious utopia just over the next hill ...",2023-10-29T21:03:01,Kuhbar,-1,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

My reply to the parent comment was specifically about ""it's not my responsibility to know or care who is living by a missile launcher"".

I'd contest that the above may be used as a defense, but even if used as (voluntary/involuntary, who's to say) human shields, there remains a bare minimum responsbility to understand the potential loss of civilian life (which would inform that defense / decision making). I mean, you'd need to understand what and where civilians are in the area to judge if they are being used as human shields. Again, you can't just level an entire city and kill thousands and say ""this was lawful because there was a missile launcher somewhere"".

Comment,">The fact that the Hamas attacks ‘didn’t happen in a vacumn’ yet they’re condeming Israel for their response is biased and bullshit. 

The Secretary General's point is more nuanced than a condemnation of Israel for their response. It focuses on the wars effect on civilians. The condemnation is focused on both Hamas attacks, tactics and on specific instances of IDF actions which resulted in civilian deaths or massive upheaval.

""It is important to also recognize the attacks by Hamas did not happen in a vacuum.

The Palestinian people have been subjected to 56 years of suffocating occupation. 

They have seen their land steadily devoured by settlements and plagued by violence; their economy stifled; their people displaced and their homes demolished.  Their hopes for a political solution to their plight have been vanishing.

But the grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the appalling attacks by Hamas.  And those appalling attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.""

The relentless bombardment of Gaza by Israeli forces, the level of civilian casualties, and the wholesale destruction of neighborhoods continue to mount and are deeply alarming. 

I mourn and honour the dozens of UN colleagues working for UNRWA – sadly, at least 35 and counting – killed in the bombardment of Gaza over the last two weeks.

I owe to their families my condemnation of these and many other similar killings.

The protection of civilians is paramount in any armed conflict.""

Protecting civilians can never mean using them as human shields.

Protecting civilians does not mean ordering more than one million people to evacuate to the south, where there is no shelter, no food, no water, no medicine and no fuel, and then continuing to bomb the south itself.""",2023-10-29T21:17:18,Ornery_Tension3257,11,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

In the battle for Mosul against ISIS, Kurdish intelligence believes approximately 40k civilians lost their lives.  Mosul was ""defended"" by 3,000 to 12,000 ISIS militants.  Most estimates are that Hamas has in excess of 50,000 militants in Gaza.  Gaza is about twice the size of Mosul and has about 50% larger population.  The population of Gaza is mostly supportive of Hamas.  The population of Mosul overwhelmingly was not supportive of ISIS.

Comment,"Targeting the civilian population has been a military tactic for millennia. I can see how you would think it is only common now however, It was just until recently that the world seen it as detrimental and created international laws to combat it. That’s the problem with terror groups they do not follow the laws of warfare or international law at all, they wear civilian clothing which makes it difficult to see them as combatants to the public eye. It’s optics. 


You need to understand the laws of warfare, especially for a NIAC. It specifically mentions that targeting civilians is forbidden, however the exemption is if the military necessity calls for it. The situation in Gaza unfortunately calls for the destruction of the overlapping civilian infrastructure because Hamas constructed tunnels spanning across Gaza. These tunnels are used to store munitions, troop movements, transport supplies etc.  Everything done so far in this specific conflict, which can be seen publicly has been in accordance with international law of armed conflicts. 

If you would like I can email you a copy of the 1300 page manual on laws of war

Comment,"> Why would a hypothetical illegality make an actual illegality legal?

It is absurd to expect Israel to face repeated aggression from its neighbours under threat of annihilation and genocide if wars are lost, with no ability to retain any territory won to establish defensible boundaries.

This is why when the UN resolved that Israel should give back territory after the 1967 war the wording was very specific:

> Lord Caradon, chief author of the resolution, takes a subtly different slant. His focus seems to be that the lack of a definite article is intended to deny permanence to the ""unsatisfactory"" pre-1967 border, rather than to allow Israel to retain land taken by force. Border rectification by mutual agreement is allowed:
>
> Knowing as I did the unsatisfactory nature of the 1967 line I was not prepared to use wording in the Resolution which would have made that line permanent. Nevertheless it is necessary to say again that the overriding principle was the ""inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war"" and that meant that there could be no justification for annexation of territory on the Arab side of the 1967 line merely because it had been conquered in the 1967 war. The sensible way to decide permanent ""secure and recognized"" boundaries would be to set up a Boundary Commission and hear both sides and then to make impartial recommendations for a new frontier line, bearing in mind, of course, the ""inadmissibility"" principle.[25]
>
> Q. But how would one change the previous border without the acquisition of territory by war? Are you suggesting mutual concessions, that is, that both Israel and the Arabs would rationalize the border by yielding up small parcels of territory? A. Yes, I'm suggesting that... Q. And that this should be mutually done, with mutual territorial concessions? A. Yes, yes. To the benefit of all.

> So no peace except in your terms? So just keep fighting, killing and dying. Don't look to the world to support your claim to the moral high ground.

The sensible way to decide permanent ""secure and recognized"" boundaries would be to set up a Boundary Commission and hear both sides and then to make impartial recommendations for a new frontier line, bearing in mind, of course, the ""inadmissibility"" principle.[25]""

It doesn't, but the 1967 lines aren't set in stone.

The settlers aim to make extensive territory gain a fait accomplis. China annexed Tibet, Turkey effectively annexed Northern Cypress. Both of these were illegal actions by your criteria but are widely accepted.

Comment,"> A large part of 9/11 was orchestrated by Saudis. Did the US blockade Saudi Arabia and start bombing civilian centres?

A fatuous comparison.

Most of the 9/11 terrorists were Saudis, true, but they were living in Afghanistan and using Afghanistan as a training ground and staging area for their attacks. Most of the leadership of Al Qaeda was also not Saudi. There was also no evidence the Saudi government was involved in the plot, and they have always denied any involvement. 

To make it simpler: If a bunch of Irish guys move to Somalia and attack Turkey, you would invade Somalia, not Ireland.

Duh.

Edit: Also, just remembered, Al Qaeda hated the Saudi government and the royal family because after Iraq annexed Kuwait prior to the first Gulf War and started lining up along the border to Saudi Arabia so they could take the Saudi oil fields next, Bin Laden made an offer to the king to come bring Al Qaeda to help protect the holy land of Saudi Arabia. The Saudi king said, thanks but no thanks, we need real fighters, and practically pleaded with the US-led coalition to do something. Bin Laden and Al Qaeda never forgave the Saudi government for allowing the unforgivable sin of letting infidel boots touch the holy ground of Saudi Arabia. They took it as a personal affront to their honor, and Al Qaeda even mentioned it was one of the reasons they perpetrated 9/11.",2023-10-29T22:45:26,TooApatheticToHateU,2,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

Fatah, who ran the West bank, accepted Israel's right to exist and had negotiated with Israel before.

But Israel decided to undermine them and support Hamas even though they knew Hamas wanted to destroy them.

The article explains a couple of ways.  Another way I read was that when Israel removed the settlers from Gaza, it failed to give the governing party at that time (Fatah) any forewarning.

2) Don't collectively punish the population with blockades - it simply makes worse living standards, a bad economy and creates a desperate population easily radicalized and recruited by terrorists.

3) Replace military solutions with political solutions.  For instance, the UK did not solve the NI troubles by militarily beating the IRA.  They set up power-sharing agreements, disarmament.

4) Focus on rebuilding Gazan infrastructure and economy.  That's why the Marshall plan succeeded (and yes, that involved a genocidal country) - it didn't repeat the WWI mistaking of punishing a side, but rather rebuilding its economy.",2023-10-29T22:39:30,kw_hipster,0,Comment,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/29/hamas-israel-war-palestinian-civilians-jake-sullivan-comments?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other

No, I am not.  

Let me ask you this?

Why did Netahyahu continue to support Hamas after the election?

They are blockading Gaza to hurt Hama but then letting them receive cash from Qatar?  


""Meanwhile, Israel has allowed suitcases holding millions in Qatari cash to enter Gaza through its crossings since 2018, in order to maintain its fragile ceasefire with the Hamas rulers of the Strip.""

""Most of the time, Israeli policy was to treat the Palestinian Authority as a burden and Hamas as an asset. Far-right MK Bezalel Smotrich, now the finance minister in the hardline government and leader of the Religious Zionism party, said so himself in 2015.  
According to various reports, Netanyahu made a similar point at a Likud faction meeting in early 2019, when he was quoted as saying that those who oppose a Palestinian state should support the transfer of funds to Gaza, because maintaining the separation between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza would prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.""

There will never be a right to return in the sense asked for by the PLO, that would destroy Israel as a Jewish national home.

Pretty much my entire point. However that would require Israel acknowledge the validity of the UN position on occupied lands. So far not.


>why should the grandchildren of someone who fled in a war their people instigated have to right to citizenship in the country attacked?

Conquest does not in itself negate the rights of prior inhabitants to their land. That would have to be an issue for negotiation.

Probably yes, but relative to the larger land at stake a minor adjustment.

Comment,"> These referendums are to counter that propaganda

Referendum in Canada about a land far away is more representative than elections in India, right. What are you smoking ?. Must be powerful stuff.

You can poll a small number of disaffected emigrants in canada (none of whom are actually living in the country their nonsensical Referendum is about), and what is going to tell you about 32 million people living in Punjab, 43% (14 million) of whom are **not** Sikhs. Or about the millions more living in other lands they claim.

The last time khalistan was a major issue in the 1980s, more than 20,000 people died. Coupled with crime, undeniable hurts/injuries, a terror sponsoring neighbour country, and you can't see why this is something even regular people living in india fear now ?

The key words in your comment are ""in the USA set fire."" They didn't set fire to a consulate in Canada.

In Canada protesters have routinely burned/hung politicians, including Trudeau, in effigy.  We do not imprison people for even wildly objectionable political speech, and we don't coddle the pathetic sensibilities of our politicians.

If anyone in Canada issued an actual threat, no fires needed, just a real threat, then they would be arrested. Hell it has happened many times. The idea that someone says something that is disagreeable can be translated into a ""threat"" is an idea that is contrary to the rule of law.

Moreover, if a foreign government thinks the Canadian government is ""being dismissive"" it is simply not acceptable solution to send assassins to commit extra-judicial killings. This is the conduct of a cowardly bully, not a mature leader.

Indian nationlists on this very sub have made bizarre statements that it is ""routine"" for major powers to conduct assassinations in other countries and similar vile commentary. Anyone who believes that being a ""major power"" means it is okay to conduct murder campaigns does not believe in the rule of law, nor democracy, nor basic human decency.

Sikh separatism was at its fever pitch when Congress party, the current opposition was in power in 80s. They curb stomped it in 80s. The horrific anti sikh riots of Delhi happened when Indian prime minister from that party was assassinated by her sikh bodyguards. And this party is purportedly secularist and civic nationalist. Hell, for ten years between 2005-2014 when they were in power, they elected a Sikh to be their prime minister. 

As you see, things aren’t as straightforward as you might be led to believe. 

Sikhs manage their own temples. Punjabis in general and Sikhs in particular,  participate in Indian economy, military politics and society. Punjab - a fertile agricultural region - benefits most from India’s pro farmer laws. 

There may be problems but they don’t merit separatism. As it is, on ground, 72% of Punjabis voted in last elections. They have voted for both two major Indian parties in the past and have recently voted in a third party that’s gaining traction across north India for its anti corruption stance.

If multiple, simultaneous violent separatist uprisings that happened in far eastern majority-Christian Indian states failed, then it will not succeed in Punjab of all places - no, a sovereign state with over a billion people will never tolerate separatism and balkanization in its territory to happen, unless if this government were to suddenly collapse due to something like a nuclear war.

Redditors have a bizarre fetishization with supporting all kinds of separatist and independence movements anywhere, this is an extremely simplistic and infantile ""oppressor vs. oppressed"" thinking that completely ignores the demographics and geography of a region, real life ain't Hearts of Iron 4 where you can magically create a new country just because you want to.

Even if Khalistan was declared independent tomorrow and Punjab is now a sovereign state, good luck taking of your care of a small landlocked country surrounded by its enemies that is 38% Hindu, it would starve overnight due to the economic and energy blockade imposed by both India and Pakistan, what should be sought after is autonomy, religious freedom, and respect for all cultures of a state.",2023-10-29T22:28:56,Copeshit,7,Comment,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/second-khalistan-vote-held-bc-1.7011870

Comment,">Again,  different threat perception.

I think I may agree with you here. My larger point is about how to deal with that difference in perception. First there needs to be genuine effort to come to a common understanding of the actual threat, not the perceived threat. It cannot be reduced to, ""But don't you understand?? We *feel* threatened!!""

There needs to be some work done by the parties to establish first and foremost that there is clearly adequate security being provided to any diplomatic staff. I am open to believing the Canadian government failed on this most fundamental issue because I have not heard from them in any news reports any steps that were taken to increase diplomatic security in response to Indian representations that they felt threatened.

Once there is an unmistakable commitment to the safety and security of diplomats and staff, there still needs to be engagement on how to understand the threat level. It has to be possible *in practice* to establish what constitutes a live threat versus ""normal protesters."" If there can be no such practical understanding then we are at an impasse. In any case such an impasse cannot be resolved by extra-judicial killings.",2023-10-29T23:45:49,Now_then_here_there,1,Comment,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/second-khalistan-vote-held-bc-1.7011870

if wanting freedom from a country who had its politicians, police, mobs, take part in the RAPE of countless Sikh women and to this day denies justice, is a dream, then call me a dreamer. Because there is no way I will proud in a country that had so many of its institutions take part in enabling and allowing my family member to be raped in delhi while her husband was burnt alive. My grandpas sister is who this happened to and she lived with my family ever since I was a kid.

Comment,"> It’s a bad look.

To be clear, this is in [Dagestan where 83% of the population is muslim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagestan#Religion). It's basically a mountainous border province of unhappy ethnic minorities where Russia's had recurring problems with Islamic extremism. Assuming they have the manpower, I wouldn't be surprised if they used this incident as an excuse for a fresh crackdown.

Highest profile person from Dagestan most Americans or Europeans would be familiar with is the Boston Marathon Bomber. The brothers lived there for several years as teens before their parents brought them the the US. Older brother traveled to Dagestan as an adult for his radicalization/training. He fled Russia when the FSB went about dismantling his terrorist cell, but the FBI dropped the ball on his case even though the Russians warned us about him.",2023-10-29T21:20:23,Andrew5329,6,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

Actually, this is not a thing in post-Soviet Russia -- there was no documented antisemitism at the government level, in contrast to the USSR and tsarist Russian Empire before it.

That Russian father is a murderer for trying to take away a father from another family, yet he was celebrated in Russia as a hero. Which is messed up.

Comment,"Which is precisely why Muslims/Arabs are upset about this situation - in \~1880 you had about 6% Jews and 90% Arabs in the area that would become Israel/Palestine, but with major Jewish immigration to the region (which as you mentioned were often supported by government programs) by the formal creation of Israel in '48 the balance had become about 33% Jew to 60% Arab. In that context, you can see how it would seem to Arabs that their presence there for centuries had not been properly considered and their ""claim"" to the area significantly diluted leading up to the charter. 

And to make matters worse, the '48 borders gave about 60% of the land to the Jews and 40% to Arabs, with the Jews getting arguably better quality land at that. Does that seem fair at all? I'd be pretty fucking upset about that if I were an Arab with family roots there.

While I admit Europe should not have waiting so long until the full scale invasion of Ukraine to cut ties with Russia, it has beside economical also relatively strong cultural ties with Israel. This signals that we want strong, close bonds with the Israelis but it should also mean that we should be extra vocal against Israel when they do things that clearly go against European values. The fact that Russia and China don't abide to European values is pretty obvious and the reason why our relations with those countries are limited to the strict necessary.

Comment,"There's literally multiple Mosques in every major city in China. Most Muslims are doing just fine as much as people don't want to believe it. In 2014 the [Kunming massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Kunming_attack#:~:text=On%201%20March%202014%2C%20a,and%20slashed%20passengers%20at%20random.) was imo what triggered the major crackdown on the Xinjiang separatists(Uyghurs, not Muslims). The images were quite disturbing with random civilians in a pool of blood dead with groceries on the ground. It caused massive outrage from the average Chinese citizen. It was honestly not that different from Israels reaction to the Oct 7 attacks. The Uyghur camps was the CCP's solution to this problem. It's what happens when a minority terrorist group attacks a institution with much, much more power than them. This is a more nuanced situation than the Chinese ethnically cleansing the Uyghurs because...they're evil or something. It's just how China works. You don't fuck with the Han Chinese in a country where they're the vast, vast majority. Is it a fucked up situation? Yeah. But there are not pretty solutions for things like this.

Comment,"Think about it this way.

The last time people got pogrommed on European soil was the Jews. Jews get blamed for terror by Germans, 6 million get gassed. After we have bombed the fuck out of the Germans and whilst also turning away Jewish refugees from the UK and beating them on boats headed for Palestine, we then invite in lots of people who are into doing pogroms in the Arab world. 

9/11 happens, no pogroms of Muslims despite an actual terror attack. In fact there are huge peace marches demonstrating against both the Afghan and Iraq invasion.

Pogrom then almost happens again in Russia in 2023.

Comment,"Speaking as a jew, I am significantly more likely to trust Muslims good will toward me than Christians.

The extreme antisemitism were seeing in the Muslim world is actually pretty recent historically, within the last 100 years. Before that the Muslim empires were the refuge that jews fled to from Europe. The modern antisemitism in Islam is largely due to the creation of Israel as a state in what Muslim extremists see as ""their"" land, and the modern Muslim countries leaders have encouraged that antisemitism because it's politically convenient for them. 

Meanwhile the Christians murdered jews as a pass time for hundreds of years. A lot of the things that we think of as antisemitic tropes are entirely, 100% European stereotypes about Jewish people, that exist as stereotypes because of things the Europeans FORCED on Jewish people. There was not a single place in Christian Europe that did not expel or attempt to kill the jews. 

The only reason that Europe isn't just as hostile to the Jews as they were 100 years ago is because the Holocaust was so horrific to the sensibilities of post-enlightenment Christians that the governments of Europe were forced to begrudgingly accept that the jews couldn't be murdered en masse, and when some jews stayed in Europe after the Europeans tried to pressure them all to go to Israel they begrudgingly stopped the open discrimination they had previously taken part in. They support Israel because it keep the jews out of Europe, and that's really the extend of it. They know that Israel needs their support to survive as a state, and because of the damage to the image and psyche of Europe caused by the Holocaust the governments of Europe feel they need to prevent it from happening again, at least until the nearness has worn off.",2023-10-29T18:11:33,ThatDudeWithTheCat,-1,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

Comment,"> I mean, Russians were taught in school that USSR citizens were the victims in WW2, not specifically Jews.

WWII played out somewhat differently in the USSR than in Western Europe.

For a start, [few Soviet Jews were sent to death camps](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/ukraine-holocaust); most were instead shot in their villages.  Dead is still dead, of course, but that does mean that not only does one of the defining features of the Holocaust -- the death camps -- not really apply to the Soviet experience, it also means that the treatment and killing of Jews in the Soviet Union was *much* more similar to the treatment and killing of non-Jewish people there.

Moreover, the number of Jewish people killed in the USSR was [1.3M](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/jewish-losses-during-the-holocaust-by-country) to [1.5M](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/ukraine-holocaust), as compared to [14M civilian deaths](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-worldwide-deaths-world-war) and another 10M military deaths, making the murders of Jewish people a *much* smaller share of the overall death count.  By contrast, Poland had about [3M Jews killed](https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/article/jewish-losses-during-the-holocaust-by-country) out of [5.6M total deaths](https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-worldwide-deaths-world-war), or 5-10x the share of deaths that the USSR saw.

Finally, it looks like a large majority of the Jewish Soviets killed in WWII were from Ukraine, and the centers of Soviet power in Russia did not always treat Ukraine and its people as equals (e.g., the [Holodomor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor) where millions of Ukrainians had been starved to death not long before WWII).  That's not a good reason to discount the importance of the deaths of a group of people, obviously, but it likely played a role.

Taking those three factors together, it does not seem surprising that the Holocaust would have different cultural resonance in Russia than in Western Europe.

I don't doubt that Stalin used the opportunity to push nationalistic propaganda, and I don't doubt that antisemitism played a role, but it's not correct that every nation experienced WWII in general and the targeted murder of Jews in particular in the same way, and so I don't think it's reasonable to expect that every nation will teach about and remember either of those topics in the same way.

(For reference, the Holocaust was an atrocity, Hitler was evil, Stalin was evil, Putin is evil, Hamas is evil, and Jewish people have the same right to enjoy life as all people -- being able to understand why WWII and the Holocaust has different cultural resonance in Russia is not in any way incompatible with those points.)",2023-10-30T00:47:24,grundar,1,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

All Abrahamic religious texts contain similar passages, as well as passages totally contradicting them and preaching the sanctity of life.

The same way Christians range from crazed evangelical fascists to peace-centered Protestant humanitarians.

Comment,"> The largest number of Russian Jews now live in Israel. Israel is home to a core Russian-Jewish population of 900,000, and an enlarged population of 1,200,000 (including halakhically non-Jewish members of Jewish households, but excluding those who reside in Israel illegally). The Aliyah in the 1990s accounts for 85–90% of this population.

Comment,"You’re selling the US short. America has been great for Jews since its inception. There are founding fathers that praised various Jewish families for their role in the American Revolution. In fact, over a third of all European Jews migrated to the US as it was and is still the most Jewish-friendly country in history that isn’t explicitly a Jewish state. Jews, like Italians, Irish, Germans, Poles, and others, were even eventually accepted as part of the majority group (White Americans).  
  
90% of the world’s Jews that live outside of Israel live in America for a reason. It’s as close to being a Jewish homeland as any non-Jewish country has ever been and it sometimes amazes me how many American left-wing Jews deny it.",2023-10-29T19:27:56,AustralisOccidentali,10,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

Comment,"USSR had quotas. Such as, ""If Jews are only 2% of the population then they shouldn't be more than 2% of college students, academics, doctors, engineers, etc."" Unevenly applied and official guidance changed constantly, but the USSR was never in any way accepting of jews, at best mildly tolerant. So many left the _moment_ they could for a reason. If you look at when people were finally allowed to leave the country, starting in the 70s, who was leaving? Without having looked up statistics I'd hazard a guess that it was mostly Jews. They got robbed on their way out but still left because it was better to start over with almost nothing than stay.

In Israel, there are three languages printed on road signs: English, Arabic, and obviously Hebrew. But you can get around decently with Russian. If you know English and Russian you can talk to almost anyone. There's a reason for that -- a huge amount of the population are first or second (or sometimes third) generation immigrants from the USSR or countries that used to be part of it.",2023-10-29T22:32:15,gimpwiz,4,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

In the same vein the African American slave was still a slave 21 years after abolition (since he never grew up a free man), Ayn Rand grew up in a nation of freed slaves and by 21 ran to America.

She grew up without freedom, no wealth around (one rich man among a million poors is North Korea), no individualism as a culture and no freedom of speech.

Comment,"Hundreds in a country of hundreds of millions. There are Israeli flags in like a quarter of all Protestant churches. Seriously. Most religious Christians in the US support Israel and accept Jews as spiritual equals. That’s something not found anywhere else in the world. The Jewish acceptance in the US is historically unprecedented. It’s so unprecedented that some Orthodox rabbis have called Jewish assimilation in the US the Silent Holocaust since half the number of Americans that theoretically could acquire Israeli citizenship don’t identify as Jewish. There are as many quarter and half-Jewish Americans that don’t identify as there are identifying Jews. That has never before happened at such a scale.     
  
Add in that without American intervention in the World Wars and later in pushing for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in the UN, there also wouldn’t be an Israel or any European Holocaust survivors for that matter, and it makes it even greater. America’s UN Security Council veto is the primary reason why Israel isn’t under North Korea-tier sanctions.  
  
It’s really incredible how much the Jewish people have gained simply because of the US and how much Americans have gained from its acceptance of Jewish people (Einstein, Oppenheimer, Von Neumann, etc).

When the Allies gave the modern-day land of Israel back to the Jews at the end of WWII, they were told this was going to happen.

The Arab-Israeli conflict has been going on for so long now that there is plenty of blame to go around, regardless of who you support.

Comment,"Yes. So speaking of pogroms which exact ""society they originated within""? My point is there's a lot of baggage everywhere, but sometimes stuff happens for some other reasons than it seems.

Here's a minute of conspiracy theory from me:

Fun fact: there's a telegram channel called ""morning dagestan"" which is directly instigating shit over there. It was created as part of the [media network associated with Ilya Ponomarev](https://twitter.com/akhalchi/status/1718568869613203670) - channels starting with ""morning _location in Russia_"" with head channel called ""morning of the february"". It was created after the start of the war by a ""russian"" oppositioner Ilya Ponomarev who is living in Ukraine for the past 10 years or so and who has [Ukrainian citizenship](https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8C%D0%BE%D0%B2_%D0%86%D0%BB%D0%BB%D1%8F_%D0%92%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BC%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87#%D0%9F%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BB%D1%96%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%B2%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D1%8F_%D0%B2_%D0%A0%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%96%D1%97). All of those channels claim their goal to be ""decolonization"" of Russia, and all of them post rather divisive stuff. It is widely speculated how this guy who was a Duma deputy during his time in Russia, has the money to finance his media network, and it is curious how this guy is portrayed in close relations to military units ""legion free Russia"" which is directly controlled by SBU.",2023-10-29T18:02:46,Igor_Kozyrev,5,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

Comment,"Yeah, nowhere was ever really awesome. That said, having talked to many people who lived both in the US and USSR through the 40s - 90s (because obviously of familial connections), those who moved to the US generally lost most of their (ancestral and personal) paranoia that they'd be targeted by the government and/or neighbors any day, because after decades of being treated _mostly_ fine the fears sort of atrophied. Of course, most who moved to the US ended up in the northeast (especially NYC, CT, Boston, etc), some in California (which is not nearly as welcoming). Generally they had the good sense to avoid KKK-burg. I mean yeah the KKK did operate in the northeast too, but it never had the sort of power there as it did in much of the south and midwest.

I guess if I really had a point to make, which I don't, it would be that the US may not have been entirely welcoming to jews post-WW2, but US federal policy was adequately welcoming, several states and especially several metropolitan areas were pretty welcoming, and the shame and guilt of knowing about the holocaust kept most mildly-intolerant people mostly-adequately-civil in those areas, and their grandkids today didn't inherit much of the distrust or hate. On the flip side, the USSR softened its stance _somewhat_ but not much, disappearances in the night were still too common for decades after WW2, options for jews were always limited, official policy was to keep jews down, opportunity was scarce, and anti-jewish sentiment was always used as a crutch by various leaders whenever they needed a scapegoat, and neighbors could only occasionally be counted on when things got hairy.",2023-10-29T22:46:45,gimpwiz,2,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738
Comment,"Russian Empire wasn't a democracy. Russians were restricted in movement, just like Jews were. The empire was ruled until 1796 by Catherine the Great, born Princess Sophie of Anhalt-Zerbst of the ruling German family of Anhalt, married to Peter III of Russia at the age of fifteen. Peter was born Charles Peter Ulrich of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, barely spoke Russian, and was overthrown by Catherine after half a year or his rule.

The Pale of Settlement was established in 1791 with the Second Partition of Poland, when eastern parts of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth were annexed by the Russian Empire with their population, including Jews. Consequently, the Pale included little of what can be called Russia.

P.S. In fact, Jews were forbidden to live in agricultural communities at least at the establishment of the Pale.

Comment,"Ok, look, its very simple. 

The moment they activated the LHC in our origination universe, a quantum cataclysm occured that results in OUR universe being shifted into another universe. 

Imagine a clear piece of paper with a design drawn on it, being overlaid on TOP of antother piece of paper with a very simiar, not-quite-the-same design on top of it. 

We're the transparent pattern in this scenario. 

Because we're no longer in our own universe, the contextual threads of history are different. 

The LHC in THIS universe did not produce a quantum cataclysm, which is why this universe didn't shift, but was instead merged. 

If you look up anything about the LHC, all the records you will find about it are records about the LHC is this NEW universe, NOT the details of the LHC in our origination universe. 

Overall, to a layperson, the machine might LOOK the same. But key details diverge. It's design is different in several notable ways. The scientists and engineers working on it are not the same people, in many cases. I do not know the total shape of the degrees of separation, I can only say based on the math that it would have been similar but different in notable ways.

While they are similar, they are obviously different in details significant enough for one to have caused the Event, but not the other one.

If you actually start to really break down the math, this becomes exceedingly obvious to any observer, which is how me and a few colleagues have become aware of what transpired, and are working both to raise people's awareness, and also to build a solution to reverse what has been done, which we are certain CAN be done, but only with enough public awareness adn support.",2023-10-29T20:32:40,TheBirminghamBear,7,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

Comment,"Honestly, that's a really lazy take.  

Here's the Wiki map of countries by penalty for ""apostasy"":

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9b/Apostasy_laws_world_map.svg

and here's a map of countries by % Muslim population:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim_world#/media/File:Islam_percent_population_in_each_nation_World_Map_Muslim_data_by_Pew_Research.svg

Note all of the dark green (majority Muslim) countries where this is not the case.  They have enough power and are immune enough from Western pressure.  Why not there?

What you're doing is oversimplifying all the different branches of Islam into a single narrative of punitive, theocratic Islamism.  Even in the countries where this is the case, this doesn't represent *all* Muslims, that represents the ruling authorities.  Note Iran, for example, where officially there is the death penalty for ""apostasy"", but the population increasingly is trying to shrug off their autocratic/theocratic government entirely.  An increasingly Western country by most standards, by the way, until the CIA completely destabilized it in the early 1950s with a coup, triggering a death spiral towards totalitarian Islamism based on a narrative of ""Muslims vs. The West"" (over their attempts to nationalize the oil industry away from BP's control, as I understand it).  Just like there's Protestant Christianity, which at different times was punishable by the death penalty, but isn't today, people are capable of partially following some lessons from Islam and ignoring the theocratic and draconian legal codes.

One of the key points here is that theocratic policies achieve a lot of success among poor and uneducated populaces, especially if they've experienced some kind of repression or official discrimination.  The same conditions that spawned the Crusades, the Inquisition, the Salem Witch Trials, or whatever other Christian atrocities in the past - or today, how fascist-leaning evangelical Christians from poor and uneducated areas in the U.S. are drawn to religious policies.

And by the way, read Leviticus sometime.  That stuff's still technically at the core of Judaism and Christianity, depending on who you ask, and it's pretty out there in terms of draconian penalties.  But that says absolutely nothing about the mindset and behavior of every single person worldwide identifying as Christian or Jewish.",2023-10-29T22:24:47,interesta,2,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738
Comment,"Hence the Pandora's Box statement.  You can interpret A as nullifying B, or B as nullifying A, or perhaps neither are valid.  Ultimately a specific interpretation of a specific passage is going to lend its way to a belief that's objectively ethical or unethical.

Notice how in my first message I described the range of actually practiced beliefs associated with any religion, and the thousand sects therein every one of them has.  This is a real fact in reality, whether or not you want to deal with it or not.  All religions have a fundamental problem in that a rigid moral code, especially one pitched towards sanctifying the religion while condemning all other ways of looking at reality (a commonality to all Abrahamic religious texts - read Leviticus some time), is going to have harmful consequences compared to a scientific ethical approach based on the actual effects actions have on other people.

Comment,"I can't find a source for that after a cursory look, but I believe you if you say there were crimes committed against the Armenians. My point stands though even if there was/is recurring violence in a country. There were large amounts of Jewish progroms in Russia and post communist takeover they largely went away/were diminished. And to say Russia has always been this way I think is both a disservice to the many victims of the progroms as well as the many Russians and Jews that did fight to change the power structures of Tsarist Russia. Here is Lenin's speech on progroms:

""Anti-Semitism means spreading enmity towards the Jews. When the accursed tsarist monarchy was living its last days it tried to incite ignorant workers and peasants against the Jews. The tsarist police, in alliance with the landowners and the capitalists, organised pogroms against the Jews. The landowners and capitalists tried to divert the hatred of the workers and peasants who were tortured by want against the Jews. In other countries, too, we often see the capitalists fomenting hatred against the Jews in order to blind the workers, to divert their attention from the real enemy of the working people, capital. Hatred towards the Jews persists only in those countries where slavery to the landowners and capitalists has created abysmal ignorance among the workers and peasants. Only the most ignorant and downtrodden people can believe the lies and slander that are spread about the Jews. This is a survival of ancient feudal times, when the priests burned heretics at the stake, when the peasants lived in slavery, and when the people were crushed and inarticulate. This ancient, feudal ignorance is passing away; the eyes of the people are being opened.""",2023-10-29T22:46:14,rsoto2,1,Comment,https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-770738

> It is unlikely that the journalists were mistaken for combatants, especially as they were not hiding: in order to have a clear field of vision, they had been in the open for more than an hour, on the top of a hill.

Comment,">Two strikes in the same place in such a short space of time (just over 30 seconds), from the same direction, clearly indicate precise targeting.

Obviously it was targeting, that doesnt mean it was targeting of journalists intentionally 

>t is unlikely that the journalists were mistaken for combatants, especially as they were not hiding: in order to have a clear field of vision, they had been in the open for more than an hour, on the top of a hill.

So standing in a war zone with helmets and body armor and a tripod mounted camera in an area where ATGMs are getting shot from means its unlikely they were mistaken for combatants?

Comment,"> So standing in a war zone with helmets and body armor and a tripod mounted camera in an area where ATGMs are getting shot from means its unlikely they were mistaken for combatants?

It would be pretty weird for actual combatants to stand around doing nothing ""in the open for more than an hour, on the top of a hill"". And they were clearly marked.

Still I actually agree there's reasonable space for different interpretations of the events and a mistake is entirely plausible; the main issue is that the IDF has form with killing journalists (accidentally or otherwise) and lying about it.

Comment,I just watched a docu-series called Captive. One of the episodes was about a married couple doing mission work in Thailand and they were abducted & held hostage by a Thai arm of ISIS. The US government changed their long standing position of not negotiating with terrorists to be able to pay them a ransom. The terrorists did not give back the hostages. Thai authorities would not allow US special forces to rescue. They opted to do it on their own after the couple had been hostage for over a year. When Thai milk found the terrorists in the jungle they just opened fire & killed one of the hostages.,2023-10-29T19:29:37,Zissoudeux,5,Comment,https://www.timesofisrael.com/meeting-netanyahu-families-of-gaza-hostages-urge-all-for-all-prisoner-swap/

Comment,"From a ""Hamas calls everything a war crime, is this actually a war crime?"" standpoint, it's not a war crime for IDF to blow up hospitals filled with active Hamas, even if there are civilians, too.  The standard is ""disproportionate"" civilian casualties compared to the military objective, which is an intentionally vague standard.

From a ""isn't it morally better if more IDF soldiers get killed in a ground invasion instead of bombing hospitals?"" standpoint, the answer is still no.  If Hamas is in/under the hospital, then that's where the fighting is going to be.  Civilians will still be killed in the crossfire either way. Since Hamas is actively preventing evacuation, there's no reason to assume fewer civilians will die later rather than sooner.  Thinking more IDF casualties=more moral outcome means that the value of IDF lives is less than 0.  The most moral outcome here is either Hamas surrenders peacefully (not happening) or allows the civilians to evacuate before battle to save their lives (also not happening).",2023-10-29T20:14:53,Mobile-Entertainer60,8,Comment,https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2023/10/29/idf-bombs-al-quds-hospital-refute-claims-hamas/8771698601119/
Comment,"I saw someone post the actual laws governing war crimes and if you use civilian places for military purposes, it's a military target, and only a war crime if the civilian losses are 'unreasonable' (don't remember the exact lawyer lingo). To find the exact threshold you will probably have to ask an expert. 
   
There was even a special clause for hospitals, so on top of the above you also have to give warnings ahead of the attack.     
      
But generally, it's not a crime to attack civilian targets if they are used for military purposes, even if it means civilian losses.    
     
I think the point of the laws is to make it so that human shields *don't work*, which means there's no point in doing it. You gain no security and you only incur more civilian losses.
